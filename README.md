# Movie Data Analysis

This portfolio project explores trends in the TMDB dataset.  
We will ingest data from various TMDB API endpoints and store it in a SQL database.  
From there, we’ll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize trends such as top-grossing movies, actors, genres, and more.

For the initial analysis, we’ll focus on movies released between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2024.  
Movies with low popularity scores will be filtered out to improve the relevance of our insights.
